# Agile Project Proposal
## Gauresh Walia

### Project Title
Note Trader

### What and why?
An app that lets students create accounts and upload past sample midterms and finals, and other notes and class resources. If a student is taking a class that another student took, and vice versa, these students can barter and trade notes/exams. This can help students better feel prepared for their classes.

### For whom?
College students can use as much prep as possible during exam season. I know for a fact I could have benefitted from some more sample exams and similar resources in my classes.

### How?
It would be implemented in three pages. The first would be for logging in and viewing your accout details. Then there would be a place for students to upload and view their own submitted documents. Finally there will be a view for students to search through other students based upon classes they have said they are taking the current semester.

### Scope
I do believe this project can be implemented as a web app by the end of the semester. We would make the front end using React. We could store user details and files in a database. Finally, the sorting of a users' matches could be done using Elasticsearch.
